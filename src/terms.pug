                    p Visitors acknowledge and agree that TonStore is not responsible for checking and evaluating the content and/or functionalities of the dapps accessible on the Website. TonStore does not warrant or endorse and will not have any liability for any dapp provided by the Dapp Developers, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in the dapps, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of using such dapps.

                    h3 NO INVESTMENT ADVICE
                    p All materials on the Website are for informational purposes only. Neither the TonStore nor any of the persons or entities involved in any way in respect of the Website provide for legal, fiscal, trading, economical and/or any other kind of advice or recommendation that may be relied upon. It means that the information from the Website cannot be used as a basis of investment strategy and nothing in this information can be ensured to contain no errors, mistakes, mispresentations or failures.
                    p Visitors will therefore act at their own risk in accessing or in any way relying on the content of the Website and the Visitors are therefore solely responsible for any consequences thereof.

                    h3 SUBMISSION OF DAPPS
                    p The Dapp Developer has a right to submit an application to TonStore for listing its dapp on the Website. In case under the view of TonStore such dapp is appropriate, the dapp will be listed and made public on the Website.
                    p Acceptance and ranking of dapps is determined solely by TonStore at its own discretion and according to the chosen criteria, which can be changed from time to time. The ranking is for informational purpose only and cannot be classified as any type of advice.
                    p TonStore reserves the right to categorize and place dapps in certain sections. Pursuant to the specific attributes of the dapp, it might be placed in the sections of &ldquo;Games&rdquo;, &ldquo;Exchanges&rdquo;, &ldquo;Collectibles&rdquo;, &ldquo;Marketplaces&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gambling&rdquo;, &ldquo;Other&rdquo; and &ldquo;High risk&rdquo;.
                    p Provided that TonStore has limited and incomplete information about certain dapp or if it finds the dapp suspicious, such dapp might be listed in the &ldquo;High risk&rdquo; section. TonStore recommends for the Visitors to do their own due diligence before visiting the websites and/or using any of products or services provided by the dapps listed in the &ldquo;High risk&rdquo; section.
                    p If the Dapp Developer notices any discrepancy between the information about its dapp and description thereof placed on the Website, it shall immediately contact TonStore under the contacts indicated herein.
                    p TonStore retains the right, but not the obligation, to edit, move or remove any dapp if such dapp or the Dapp Developer is deemed by TonStore to violate these Terms. TonStore will have no liability for editing, moving, removing, or continuing to permit the display of any dapp. If certain dapp under the view of TonStore seems to be inappropriate, TonStore also reserves the right not to post or publish any dapp, and to delete, remove or edit any dapp, at any time in its sole discretion without notice or liability.

                    h3 ADVERTISING OF DAPPS
                    p The Dapp Developer has a right to submit an inquiry for advertising its dapp on the Website. In order to advertise the dapp, the Dapp Developer has to fill and submit the advertising inquiry. Acceptance of advertising of the dapp is determined solely by TonStore at its own discretion and according to the chosen criteria.
                    p Based on the completed details of the advertising inquiry, in the event TonStore finds the inquiry appropriate, TonStore reaches back to the dapp Developer and sends an offer with the price based on current availability, advertising slot and period for advertising. As soon as the payment from the dapp Developer is received, the advertisement of the dapp is made public and visible on the Website. After receipt of the payment, the dapp Developer does not have a right to a refund.
                    p In the event the dapp is listed in the &ldquo;High risk&rdquo; section as it is indicated in the Article 5.4 hereof, TonStore does not accept any inquiries for advertising from such dapp Developers.
                    p TonStore is not the sponsor or promoter of the dapps, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for such advertising.
                    p TonStore retains the right to remove any advertising of the dapp on the Website if such advertising or Dapp Developer is deemed by TonStore to violate these Terms. In case of violation of provisions of these Terms, TonStore has no obligation to return any payments made by the dapp Developer to TonStore and has no liability for removing any of such advertising.

                    h3 OWNERSHIP OF DAPPS
                    p Any and all description, text, pictures, graphics, and other content or information about the dapps is generated, owned and controlled solely by the dapp Developers, and not by TonStore.
                    p TonStore does not claim any ownership rights in the listed dapps, and Dapp Developers acknowledge and agree that they remain solely responsible to damage caused by their dapps.
